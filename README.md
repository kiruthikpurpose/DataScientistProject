# 📘 Data Science Specialization — Machine Learning Track

This repository is part of my **Data Science Specialization Journey**, focused mainly on **Machine Learning basics**, including **Supervised** and **Unsupervised Learning**, along with data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.

### ✨ Credits  
Small appreciation to our technical trainers:  
**Praveena**, **Dheepika**, **Swamynathan**  
for guiding us throughout this machine learning specialization.
